It's interesting that the title, link format as in `![This is an image](IMG_1738.jpg)` doesn't permit image resizing. To manage this(as in the tennis racquet lower on the page, I have to use code similar to `<img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0017/8244/8198/products/102358_Pure_Aero_team_face_grande_2438d782-5882-4144-8946-4d17c8c06707.jpg?v=1612923808" width="125" height="150">`

### Classic Games, Especially Arcade Games!
These days, I find myself overwhelmed by modern entertainment, and by the modern world in general. I love playing the classics and going to arcades! They are a nice, fun, and interesting retreat from the majority of the present world! Classic games don't usually come with the complexities and over-development of that which is more modern, and everyone who goes to such places is there to enjoy the environment that such places bring about! As for the games themselves, they aged like fine wine, still pulsing with the innovation that brought them about!
Some of my favorite classics include:
- The Legend of Zelda
- Donkey Kong
- MotoGP racing simulator
- Super Mario

My favorite is ~~Pac-Man~~ ~~The Legend of Zelda~~ ~~Super Mario~~ ~~Mega Man~~ Goodness! It's too hard to decide!
